I am writing about building Apps using SwiftUI - mostly concerning macOS, but also some aspects covering iOS, iPadOS and watchOS will be covered.

Many topics came up, when I was redesigning and rewriting the multiplatform app for language learning [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com/). Wokabulary helps you learn and organize foreign words efficiently and is available for [iPhone, iPad](https://apps.apple.com/app/wokabulary/id599276235) and [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/wokabulary/id599273012).
My colleagues at [Coding Friends](https://www.coding-friends.com/) and I originally build with Swift and Objective-C.
