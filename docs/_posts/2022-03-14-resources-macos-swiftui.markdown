# Useful resources for SwiftUI on macOS

A great start are the two Videos of a code along [„SwiftUI on the Mac“ from WWDC21](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10062), where the main principles are described end where you get an overview of a basic App structure and navigation.

Besides the great Tutorials on Swift, SwiftUI and iOS - which I can highly recommend, not only for beginners, but also to freshen up your Swift-skills or when changing over from UIKit - Paul Hudson’s Hacking with Swift  also has a course on macOS Apps. It includes 18 App projects to get you started with [Hacking with macOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos) that gets you started with interface components, split views and navigation as well as with animation.
